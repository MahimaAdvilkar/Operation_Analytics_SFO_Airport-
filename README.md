# ‚úàÔ∏è Passenger Flow and Operations at SFO ‚Äì Operational Analytics Project

**Created by:** Mahima Advilkar  
**Role:** Data Analyst  
**Domain:** Operations Analytics | Aviation Industry  
**Tools Used:** Python, Excel, Tableau, Time Series Forecasting, Regression

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores operational and passenger flow data at **San Francisco International Airport (SFO)**. By integrating two public datasets‚ÄîAir Traffic Passenger Statistics and Landing Statistics‚Äîwe applied regression and forecasting techniques to understand key trends, inform strategic airport planning, and enhance passenger experience.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze what factors impact passenger flow the most  
- Forecast future passenger volumes using time series models  
- Identify operational bottlenecks across terminals and boarding areas  
- Derive actionable business recommendations for airport authorities

---

## üßæ Datasets Used

- **Air Traffic Passenger Statistics**  
  Monthly passenger counts by terminal, boarding area, and activity type (deplaned, enplaned, transit)

- **Air Traffic Landings Statistics**  
  Landing information by aircraft type, weight, airline operations

## üõ† Tools & Techniques

- Python, Pandas, Excel ‚Äì Data integration, cleaning, analysis  
- Time Series Models ‚Äì 3-Month Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing  
- Regression ‚Äì Identify impact of aircraft and landing stats on flow  
- Tableau ‚Äì Interactive dashboards for insights and presentation

## üìä Key Insights

| Insight Category         | Observation |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Passenger Variability    | Highest traffic in June 2024 (5,987); lowest in Nov 2023 (4,536) |
| Forecasting Accuracy     | Exponential Smoothing MAPE: 5.20% vs Moving Avg: 29.52% |
| Airline Ops              | United, SkyWest, Delta dominate operations |
| Aircraft Types           | Narrow-body aircraft dominate domestic routes |
| Boarding Areas           | Area A = 24,723 passengers; Area E = 2,929 (low traffic) |
| Regional Distribution    | Domestic: 54%, Asia: 22%, Europe: 14% |
| Annual Growth            | 345% traffic increase from 2023 to 2024 |

## üìà Forecasting

| Month (2024) | Moving Avg Forecast | Exp. Smoothing Forecast |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| October      | 5,437               | 5,360                    |
| November     | 5,411               | 5,072                    |
| December     | 5,321               | 5,214                    |

üìâ **Exponential Smoothing** provided more accurate and stable predictions for future planning.

## üí° Business Recommendations

- **Terminal Optimization**: Reallocate resources from Terminal 3 & 2 to high-traffic Terminal 1  
- **Expand International Routes**: Add flights to underserved regions (Middle East, Oceania)  
- **Develop Transit Hubs**: Improve services in transit-heavy regions like the US and Europe  
- **Optimize Boarding Areas**: Expand Area A, streamline low-traffic zones  
- **Cargo & Aircraft Ops**: Support freighter growth, invest in wide-body infrastructure  
- **Peak Readiness**: Use forecasts for seasonal staff and gate planning
